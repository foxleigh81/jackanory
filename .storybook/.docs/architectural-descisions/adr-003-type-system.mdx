# ADR 003: Use TypeScript for type safety and developer experience

- **Date created**: 04/02/2025
- **Driver**: Alex Foxleigh (Foxy)

## Status

![accepted]

## Context

The project requires a robust type system to ensure:

- Type safety across the entire codebase
- Better developer experience with IDE support
- Reduced runtime errors and bugs
- Self-documenting code through type definitions
- Improved refactoring capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration between team members

Alternative approaches considered:

- **JavaScript with JSDoc**: Lightweight but limited type checking
- **Flow**: Facebook's type checker but declining adoption
- **Plain JavaScript**: No type safety, higher risk of runtime errors
- **PropTypes**: React-specific but limited to component props

## Decision

Use TypeScript as the primary language for all JavaScript/React code in the Jackanory project.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **IDE Support**: Excellent autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation in modern IDEs
- **Self-Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation for functions and components
- **Refactoring**: Safe and confident refactoring with type checking
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear interfaces and contracts between different parts of the codebase
- **Ecosystem**: Strong TypeScript support in React, Next.js, and most modern libraries
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be adopted incrementally in existing JavaScript projects
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in the React/Node.js ecosystem

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn TypeScript syntax and concepts
- **Build Complexity**: Additional compilation step and configuration
- **Development Overhead**: Writing types takes additional time initially
- **Library Support**: Some libraries may have poor or missing type definitions
- **Strict Mode**: Can be restrictive and require workarounds for dynamic patterns

### Mitigations

- Start with basic TypeScript and gradually adopt more advanced features
- Leverage community-maintained type definitions from DefinitelyTyped
- Configure TypeScript with appropriate strictness levels for the team
- Provide TypeScript training and resources for team members

## Implementation Notes

- Use strict mode configuration for maximum type safety
- Leverage utility types and generics for reusable type definitions
- Create custom type definitions for project-specific patterns
- Use type-only imports where appropriate to optimize bundle size
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for types and interfaces
