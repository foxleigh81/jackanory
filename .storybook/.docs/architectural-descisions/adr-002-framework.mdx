# ADR 002: Use Next.js as the React framework

- **Date created**: 04/02/2025
- **Driver**: Alex Foxleigh (Foxy)

## Status

![accepted]

## Context

The project requires a React-based framework that can support:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO
- Static site generation (SSG) for optimal loading times
- Modern development experience with hot reload and fast refresh
- Built-in optimization features for images, fonts, and bundling
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Flexible routing system
- Production-ready deployment capabilities
- Strong ecosystem and community support

Alternative frameworks considered:

- **Create React App (CRA)**: Simple but limited, no SSR/SSG, being deprecated
- **Vite + React**: Fast development but requires additional configuration for SSR
- **Remix**: Good SSR but smaller ecosystem and steeper learning curve
- **Gatsby**: Excellent for static sites but complex for dynamic content

## Decision

Use Next.js as the primary React framework for the Jackanory design system and applications.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Built-in SSR/SSG capabilities improve initial page load times
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering improves search engine optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent development tools, hot reload, and debugging
- **Optimization**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and font optimization
- **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support without additional configuration
- **Deployment**: Seamless deployment to Vercel and other platforms
- **Ecosystem**: Large community, extensive documentation, and plugin ecosystem
- **Future-proof**: Active development by Vercel with regular updates and improvements

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand SSR/SSG concepts and Next.js patterns
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple client-side React applications
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some features are optimized for Vercel deployment
- **Bundle Size**: Framework overhead compared to minimal React setups
- **Opinionated**: Specific file structure and routing conventions must be followed

### Mitigations

- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for Next.js patterns
- Use incremental adoption - start with static generation where appropriate
- Maintain deployment flexibility by avoiding Vercel-specific features where possible
- Leverage Next.js optimization features to offset bundle size concerns
