The `Icon` component is used to display icons in the UI. It uses a script to
automatically generate icons from SVG files in the `lib/icons` folder.

<Tip type="note">
  This is for internal, custom icons only. You can also use icons from the
  react-icons package. Please consult the [react-icons
  documentation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for more
  information.

## Usage

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story of={Stories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

## Adding a new icon

To add a new icon, simply you can copy an existing icon from the 'src/components/data-display/icon/components' folder and replace the svg contents. Please ensure you maintain the 'fill', 'ref' and '...props' attributes in the svg tag.

### Icon guidelines

In order to keep the icon library consistent, please follow these guidelines when creating new icons:

- Icons should be square
- Icons should not have any colour or fill applied unless absolutely necessary
- Icons should not have any stroke applied
- Icons should not require any fonts or external resources
- Icons should not have any padding or whitespace around them
- Icons should not use any special effects such as drop shadows, gradients or glows
- Any icon used in a way that would require a description for accessibility purposes should have a `title` element with a description of the icon

<Tip type="danger">
  Icons that do not follow these guidelines may cause issues when generating the
  icon library and/or may not display correctly in the UI.
</Tip>

## Styling the icon

As the Icon component just returns an SVG element, you can style it using CSS as you would any other SVG element by adding a `className` prop to the Icon and then styling it in your CSS file.

## Gallery

<Tip type="note">
  All icons in the gallery are locked at 50px width for the sake of a neat
  layout in Storybook. You can customise the size of the icon by passing a
  'width' prop.
