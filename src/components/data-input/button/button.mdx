  It's also possible to turn a regular button element or link into a basic
  button by adding the `button` utility to it although that method is cosmetic
  only and lacks the more advanced features of this component.

## Overview

The Button component is a versatile UI element that can be configured in many ways to suit different use cases. It supports various styles, sizes, and states while maintaining accessibility and consistent styling.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use the Button component is with just a label:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Primary} />

## Button Content

### Using Props

The most common way to add content to a button is through props:

```tsx
<Button label="Click me" />
```

### Using Children

You can also pass content as children, which gives you more flexibility:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithChildren} />

## Variants

The Button component supports several variants to indicate different actions or importance levels.

### Primary

The default variant, used for the most important actions:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Used for less prominent actions:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Secondary} />

### Create

Specifically styled for creation actions:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Create} />

### Destroy

Used for destructive actions like deletion:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Destroy} />

## Text-Only Buttons

### Transparent Button

A button with no background, maintaining the same padding and sizing:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Transparent} />

### Link Button

Styled to look like a link while maintaining button functionality:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.DisplayAsLink} />

## Icon Buttons

### Built-in Icons

You can use any icon from our icon library:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithIcon} />

### Custom React Icons

You can also use custom React icons from libraries like react-icons:

```tsx
import { FaStar } from 'react-icons/fa';

<Button icon={<FaStar />} label="Star" />;
```

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithCustomIcon} />

### Icon Placement

Icons can be aligned to either side of the text:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.IconLeft} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.IconRight} />

### Icon-Only Buttons

For a cleaner look, you can hide the label while maintaining accessibility:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.IconOnly} />

## Circular Buttons

Circular buttons are perfect for icon-only actions:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Circular} />

### Circular with Custom Icons

You can combine circular buttons with custom icons:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.CustomIconOnly} />

## Size Variants

### Small Buttons

For more compact interfaces:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Small} />

### Small with Icons

Small buttons work well with icons:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SmallWithIcon} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SmallWithIconAndLabel} />

## States

### Disabled

Buttons can be disabled to prevent interaction:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Disabled} />

### Loading

Show a loading state with optional custom text:

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Loading} />

## Accessibility

The Button component is built with accessibility in mind:

- All buttons require a label (either through the `label` prop or children)
- Loading states are properly announced to screen readers
- Disabled states are properly communicated
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Icons are properly hidden from screen readers when used decoratively

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide a label** - Even for icon-only buttons, provide a descriptive label for accessibility
2. **Choose appropriate variants** - Use primary for main actions, secondary for less important ones
3. **Consider button size** - Use small buttons in dense interfaces
4. **Use loading states** - Show loading states for async actions
5. **Be consistent** - Use the same variant for similar actions throughout your interface

## Common Patterns

### Navigation

```tsx
<Link href="/some-page">
  <Button icon="arrow-left" label="Back" />
</Link>
```

### Form Actions

```tsx
<Button variant="create" icon="plus" label="Add Item" onClick={handleAdd} />
```

### Destructive Actions

```tsx
<Button
  variant="destroy"
  icon={<FaTrash />}
  label="Delete"
  onClick={handleDelete}
/>
```

### Loading States

```tsx
<Button label="Save" isLoading={isSaving} loadingIndicator="Saving..." />
```
