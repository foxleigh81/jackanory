## üèó Project Architecture

This project follows **component-driven development** principles with clean separation of concerns:

- **`/src/app`** - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- **`/src/components`** - Organized component library with categories:
  - **`data-display`** - Components for presenting information
  - **`data-input`** - Form controls and input components
  - **`feedback`** - User feedback components (toasts, alerts)
  - **`layout`** - Structural components (panels, masthead)
  - **`navigation`** - Navigation and routing components
  - **`factories`** - Data-driven component generators
- **`/src/libs`** - Shared utilities, helpers, types, and mocks
- **`/src/theme`** - Comprehensive design system with SCSS variables
- **`/docs`** - Project documentation and architectural decisions
- **`/public`** - Static assets including logos and icons

### Design System

Jackanory includes a comprehensive design system built with SCSS:

- **Typography System**: Consistent font sizing, weights, and spacing
- **Color Palette**: Semantic color tokens with light/dark mode support
- **Breakpoint System**: Mobile-first responsive design utilities
- **Component Theming**: Centralized styling with CSS custom properties
- **Utility Classes**: Common styling patterns for rapid development

### Architectural Decisions

Technical decisions are documented in our [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](./docs/architectural-descisions/):

## üß© Component Library

Jackanory provides a rich set of components organized by function:

### Data Display Components

- **Cards & Panels**: Flexible content containers with overlay positioning
- **Tables**: Data presentation with factory-based generation
- **Typography**: Consistent text styling and hierarchy

### Data Input Components

- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, and specialized button variants
- **Forms**: Complete form controls with validation support
- **Interactive Elements**: User input components with accessibility

### Layout Components

- **Masthead**: Responsive header with navigation and actions
- **Site Logo**: Branded logo component with multiple variants
- **Panels**: Draggable overlay panels with positioning options

### Navigation Components

- **Site Navigation**: Responsive navigation with mobile menu support
- **Routing**: Context-aware navigation components

### Feedback Components

- **Collection Factories**: Create component collections from configuration

## üîÆ Future Considerations

Based on our architectural foundation, several enhancements are planned for future iterations:

### üé® **Enhanced Design System**
