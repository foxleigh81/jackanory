# ADR 005: Use Storybook for component development and documentation

- **Date created**: 04/02/2025
- **Driver**: Alex Foxleigh (Foxy)

## Status

![accepted]

## Context

The project requires a tool for:

- Isolated component development and testing
- Interactive component documentation
- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Design system showcase and exploration
- Collaboration between designers and developers
- Automated accessibility testing
- Component API documentation

Alternative approaches considered:

- **Custom documentation site**: Full control but significant development overhead
- **Docusaurus**: Good for documentation but limited component interaction
- **Styleguidist**: React-focused but less feature-rich than Storybook
- **Bit**: Component sharing platform but more complex setup
- **In-app development**: Developing components within the main application

## Decision

Use Storybook as the primary tool for component development, documentation, and testing.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Isolated Development**: Develop components in isolation without application dependencies
- **Interactive Documentation**: Live, interactive examples that serve as documentation
- **Design System Showcase**: Central location to explore and understand all components
- **Testing Integration**: Built-in support for accessibility, visual, and interaction testing
- **Collaboration**: Shared environment for designers, developers, and stakeholders
- **Addon Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of addons for additional functionality
- **Version Control**: Component stories are version controlled alongside code
- **Export Capabilities**: Can generate static documentation sites for deployment

### Negative

- **Setup Complexity**: Initial configuration and setup can be complex
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Stories need to be maintained alongside components
- **Build Time**: Additional build step and potential CI/CD complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Storybook concepts and best practices
- **Dependency**: Additional dependency in the project stack

### Mitigations

- Start with basic stories and gradually add more complex interactions
- Establish clear conventions for writing and organizing stories
- Integrate Storybook into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline
- Provide training and documentation for team members
- Use Storybook's auto-documentation features to reduce manual maintenance

## Implementation Notes

- Configure Storybook with Next.js integration for seamless development
- Use Controls addon for interactive component property manipulation
- Implement accessibility testing with the a11y addon
- Set up visual regression testing with Chromatic or similar tools
- Create comprehensive stories covering all component variants and states
- Use MDX for rich documentation alongside component stories
- Configure automatic deployment of Storybook for stakeholder review

## Story Writing Guidelines

- Write stories for all component variants and states
- Include edge cases and error states
- Use realistic data and content in stories
- Document component APIs with JSDoc comments
- Create interaction tests for complex component behaviors
- Organize stories with clear naming conventions and grouping
