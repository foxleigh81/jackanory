## Useful Commands

### Development

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server and Storybook instance concurrently
- `npm run next` - Starts only the Next.js development server with Turbopack
- `npm run storybook` - Starts only the Storybook development server

### Building

- `npm run build` - Builds the production application
- `npm run build:analyse` - Generates a bundle analysis report to help identify large dependencies and optimize bundle size
- `npm run build-storybook` - Builds the Storybook static site
- `npm start` - Starts the production server

### Testing

- `npm test` - Runs all tests (TypeScript, Storybook, and unit tests)
- `npm run test:ts` - Runs TypeScript type checking
- `npm run test:storybook` - Runs Storybook interaction tests
- `npm run test:unit` - Runs unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run test:storybook:ci` - Runs Storybook tests in CI environment

### Code Quality

- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check code quality
